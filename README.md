#simplgrep

##A grep implementation

An implementation of the classic grep command line tool, which allows you to search text files for a keyword and return matching lines.

Major points the project teaches are
  * intermediate rust coding
  * tests and TDD in rust
  * efficient and safe error handling in rust
  * Proper module structure for rust programs

If you would like to try out building this tool yourself, head to the [rust book second edition](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/index.html) and work your way to chapter 12.
